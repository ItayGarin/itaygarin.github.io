Hello!   
I'm Itay Garin. Welcome to my personal blog!

I'll be regularly posting on various topics that are of interest to me.
But mainly on the low-level computing world.
More specifically, on embedded R&D, operation systems, and systems programming.

Additionally, I'll probably discuss my professional workflow, brag about my awesome Emacs config, and elaborate on my side projects.

Finally, I'd like to thank you for checking out my blog!  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

So please feel free to reach out to me on **itay.garin@gmail.com** or [@ItayGarin](https://www.twitter.com/ItayGarin) on Twitter.
